This repository stores my solutions for the [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com).

If you have come here looking for easy answers, please make an attempt to solve these problems on your own. They aren't very difficult, and I found it fun to challenge myself by trying them with different paradigms.

All solutions should take input from stdin and output the answer with a trailing newline.

The usual syntax is:
```
./adventX.x{.extension} < AdventX.stdin
```

You can get the input files by signing up [Here](http://adventofcode.com)
